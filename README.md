# SurfacePsycho
SurfacePsycho Blender addon

The addon offers a new surfacing workflow optimized for industrial deigners. It notably allows .STEP export, several continuity types and some forms of trimming (much more in progress). By using GeometryNodes on meshes objects, it benefits from many vanilla blender tools such as sculting, and I recommand the following addons to work with :
* [EdgeFlow](https://github.com/BenjaminSauder/EdgeFlow)
* LoopTools (Shipped with Blender)
